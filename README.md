# 🚗 Car Rental App – Android Studio Project

This is an Android application developed as a college project for a **Android Development Course**. Built in a team of three, the app simulates a complete **car rental system**, featuring both **customer-facing** and **admin interfaces**.

## 👩‍💻 My Role

As part of the team, I was fully responsible for the **entire front-end layout** of the application, both for **customers and admins**. I built all the **user interfaces** using XML in Android Studio, including layout design, structure, and screen transitions.

This project was completed in **just two weeks**. It was intense, especially as it was my **first real UI development experience**, but it turned out to be both challenging and incredibly enjoyable!
